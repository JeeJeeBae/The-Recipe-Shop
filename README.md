# App Design



# Planned future enhancements (icebox items)
- Add the abilities for users to delete their own recipes
- Add servings to the recipe equation
- 


# Challenges
It was a challenge over all as this was my first time creating an app from scratch including registration and login of users. The project solidified my understanding of how it all works overall(frontend + backend)
